        <h1>Camino de Santiago</h1>
        <p>The Camino is an ancient pilgrimage which either goes to Santiago de Compostela or through that city to Finisterre on the west coast of Spain. There are many  routes that one can follow on their <em>Camino</em> although the main routes follow Roman roads and trade routes. Traditionally a camino starts at the pilgrim's home but mdern day pilgrims head to significant places such as Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port in France or Roncesvalles in  Northern Spain.</p>
        <p>Upon reaching Santiago de Compostela a pilgrim is eligible for a <em>compostela</em> if they have walked at least 100km cumulatively during their pilgrimage although it is not unusual to have walked more than 700km over 30 or 40 days. The most common route, the 'Camino Frances' or 'French Way' is approximately 769km alhough this can vary if the pilgrim takes detours or shortcuts.</p>
        <h2>The Credencial</h2>
        <p>The 'credencial' or 'passport' is how a pilgrim proves how far they have walked each day. The credencial is stamped at each 'albergue' (speical camino hostel) and/or at a cafe along the route. Generally a pilgrim aims to get at least 2 stamps per day and some albergues require evidence that the pilgrim has walked at least 30km that day in order to get a bed.</p>
